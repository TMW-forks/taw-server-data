##3 Minor updates
##3 03-01-2010

##0 Valentines day is long over, cupid has left.
##0 If you haven't checked out HiTomb yet, you
##0 should! The residents there need your help!

##3 New area
##3 2010-02-08

##0 A wizard passed through and opened a passage 
##0 to an entirely new area. Rumor has it that 
##0 it's reachable via the Mouboo Hills. 
##0 Residents of Hurnscald remain skeptical 
##0 and continue to insist that no such place 
##0 exists. Cupid has been spotted wandering 
##0 the area..

##3 Tinkering
##3 2010-01-11

##0 We start 2010 with some tinkering.
##0 And WOW have we been tinkering with a lot of 
##0 stuff. Check around Hurnscald for some
##0 new quests! Look for Da Boss, and for Bella they
##0 both have some things to do, some interesting 
##0 rewards.

##0 Also get some Druids advise for life from
##0 the Oracle. His wisdom is uncanny. He likes
##0 quiet outside places.

##0 All of these things are products of teamwork 
##0 with the players and developers. Enjoy !!
